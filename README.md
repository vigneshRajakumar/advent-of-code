# Advent Of Code

I found out about this cool idea in December 2020. I saw it as a pretty fun way to test out a new language or technology that piqued my interest during the year.

## 2020
This year I started using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) extensively so I decided to code up most of the challenges as notebooks using python.

I used Wim Glenn's [`advent-of-code-data`](https://pypi.org/project/advent-of-code-data/) package to get the data into my notebooks.
